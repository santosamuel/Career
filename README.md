# Career
This is a career page which includes my portofolio, recent projects and my curriculum vitae. 
A little you must know about myself is that I enthusiast in problem solving specifically mathematical and logical problems, those "Aha!" or "Eureka!" moments makes me feel like I am the smartest man in the world. I pleasure those moments as a reminder of my passion in the world of analytical matter.

# Project 1
My earliest project was in contribution of "Kompetisi Matematika" 
<ol> held by Parahyangan Catholic University which is my alma mater. To better accomodate my colleagues, I managed to build a simple program using python to auto grade around 150 students, the yield was proven to be correct as the final round of the competition was very competitive according to the judges.
